### Style Library

The template used to build the style library is found in
<code>static/bolt/docs-template/</code>. It's pretty straightforward. The
style library is generated from KSS comments found in CSS files. Configuration
is in <code>gulpfile.js</code>.

#### Image URLs

Images in the style library are randomly generated by
<a href="https://source.unsplash.com/">source.unsplash.com</a>.
To include an image, use the URL <code>//source.unsplash.com/random/400x400</code>,
replacing <code>400x400</code> with your desired <code>width x height</code>.
